Data Processing Log

Step 1: Import Libraries
Imported pandas and numpy libraries for data manipulation and analysis.
Set warnings to be ignored to keep the output clean.

Step 2: Load Dataset
Loaded data from the .csv file "Assignment1Data_Sample.csv".
Displayed the first five rows of the dataset for initial inspection.

Step 3: Data Overview
Checked the shape of the dataset to understand its dimensions (rows and columns).
Used info() to get a summary of the dataset, including data types and non-null counts.

Step 4: Data Selection
Selected specific columns relevant for analysis:
Object ID, Department, Object Name, Title, Culture, Artist Nationality, Object Begin Date, Object End Date, Medium, Credit Line, Country.

Step 5: Uniqueness Check
Checked if Object ID is unique by using value_counts().
Dropped duplicate entries to ensure each Object ID is unique.

Step 6: Data Type Conversion
Changed data types of categorical columns (Department, Culture, Artist Nationality, Credit Line, Country) to 'category'.
Converted Object End Date to an integer type.

Step 7: Missing Values Analysis
Checked for missing values across the dataset.
For columns with missing values, performed the following:
Replaced NaN in Department, Object Name, Title, Culture, Artist Nationality, and Country with 'Unknown'.
Filled missing values in Object End Date with corresponding values from Object Begin Date.

Step 8: Year Conversion
Defined a function convert_to_bc() to convert negative years to a "BC" format.
Applied this function to Object Begin Date and Object End Date.

Step 9: Row Dropping
Dropped rows where both Object Begin Date and Object End Date were missing.

Step 10: Data Consistency Checks
Checked for consistency in data across all columns to perform further data cleaning if needed.

Step 11: Data Cleaning
Cleaned the Culture column by removing uncertainty words and extracting primary cultures.
Standardized values in the Culture column (e.g., changing 'Japan' to 'Japanese').
Cleaned the Artist Nationality column by removing unnecessary characters and consolidating nationalities.
Replaced '[no medium available]' in the Medium column with 'Unknown'.
Cleaned the Country column by removing 'present-day' from values.

Step 12: Final Data Overview & Saving Data in .csv file
Reviewed the cleaned and processed data, ensuring consistency and readiness for analysis.
Saved the cleaned data in "Cleaned Assignment1.csv" file
